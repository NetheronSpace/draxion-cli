> **‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Experimental Prototype**

## üìú Description

This repository contains the source code for the command-line interface (CLI) client for **Draxion**, a secure cloud file storage service. The client is designed under a **zero-trust** and **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** philosophy, where the client is solely responsible for key management and data encryption.

### Language Clarification

> A significant part of the code was originally written in Spanish. Efforts are underway to standardize everything to English, but remnants of the original language may still exist. This will be corrected in future updates.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Zero-Knowledge Authentication:** Proves possession of the master password without revealing it to the server, using a ZKP protocol.
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** Files are encrypted and decrypted locally. The server only stores unreadable data blobs.
*   **Concurrent File Management:** Upload and download files in parallel for greater efficiency.
*   **Disaster Recovery:** Implements Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) to split the master key into recoverable fragments.
*   **Secure Sharing:** Share files with other users by forwarding the file key, encrypted with the recipient's public key.
